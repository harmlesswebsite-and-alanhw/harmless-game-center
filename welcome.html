    <h1>Welcome to the Harmless Game Center.</h1>
    <p>The window system is still being heavily developed and may be broken at times.</p>
    <p>Using this system, you can play minigames offline. Several other non-game utilities are also incorporated.</p>
    <p>You will not see this message next time. If you would like to see this message the next time you start this program, <button onclick="this.textContent = '...what did I say? Never mind, it will appear next time.'; this.disabled = 'disabled'; localStorage.removeItem('firstrun');">clear the first run counter</button>.</p>
    <h2>How this was made</h2>
    <p>The Harmlesswebsite Game Center was based off of the game library in Harmlesswebsite, level 6, minilevel 3. More features were added, such as the ability to open multiple windows at once and drag them around.</p>
    <h2>Boring legal stuff</h2>
